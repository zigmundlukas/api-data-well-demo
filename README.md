# Well Data Upload API

This API allows uploading well and wellbore data from a server to a desktop app, where users can observe, manage, and save this data as a project. Once the data is saved as a project in the app, there is no need to re-upload it unless new data is required. Below are the step-by-step instructions with notes to guide you through the process.

---

## Step 1: Authentication

Before making any requests to the API, you must authenticate using an **API key**. This API key is provided to you when you register or create an account with the service.

### Explanatory Note:
- The API key ensures that only authorized users can access and manipulate the data. If you donâ€™t provide a valid API key, the API will respond with an **Unauthorized** error.
- Include the API key in the `Authorization` header in each request to ensure successful authentication.

### Example Request Header:
```plaintext
Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>
```

## Step 2: Upload Well and Wellbore Data

This step involves sending the **well and wellbore data** from the server to the desktop application.

### Endpoint:
```
POST /data/upload
```

### Explanatory Note:
- The request body must contain information about the wells and wellbores that need to be uploaded to the desktop application.
- The data structure should include the well and wellbore properties like **well ID**, **name**, **depth**, **location**, and **status**.
- This data will then be displayed in the desktop application where you can manage it.

### Request Body (JSON):
```json
{
  "wells": [
    {
      "well_id": "WEL-001",
      "name": "Well 1",
      "location": "Site A",
      "depth": 5000,
      "status": "Active"
    },
    {
      "well_id": "WEL-002",
      "name": "Well 2",
      "location": "Site B",
      "depth": 3000,
      "status": "Inactive"
    }
  ],
  "wellbores": [
    {
      "wellbore_id": "WB-001",
      "well_id": "WEL-001",
      "depth": 1000,
      "status": "Cased",
      "orientation": "Vertical"
    },
    {
      "wellbore_id": "WB-002",
      "well_id": "WEL-002",
      "depth": 1500,
      "status": "Open",
      "orientation": "Horizontal"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Response (Success):
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Data uploaded successfully",
  "data": {
    "wells": [
      {
        "well_id": "WEL-001",
        "status": "Active"
      },
      {
        "well_id": "WEL-002",
        "status": "Inactive"
      }
    ],
    "wellbores": [
      {
        "wellbore_id": "WB-001",
        "status": "Cased"
      },
      {
        "wellbore_id": "WB-002",
        "status": "Open"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Response (Error):
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Unable to upload data. Please try again later."
}
```

---

## Step 3: Save Data as a Project

Once the data is uploaded to the desktop application, save it as a **project**. This step allows the user to organize and retain the uploaded data for future reference, making it easier to access the data later without needing to upload it again.

### Endpoint:
```
POST /projects/save
```

### Explanatory Note:
- A **project** is a collection of data related to specific wells and wellbores that you can work with in the desktop application. By saving the data as a project, you can continue working on it locally without the need to constantly re-upload it.
- A project has a **name** and a **description** to help you organize multiple projects.

### Request Body (JSON):
```json
{
  "project_name": "Project 1",
  "description": "This is the project for observing Well 1 and Well 2.",
  "wells": [
    "WEL-001",
    "WEL-002"
  ],
  "wellbores": [
    "WB-001",
    "WB-002"
  ]
}
```

### Response (Success):
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Project saved successfully",
  "project_id": "PRJ-001"
}
```

### Response (Error):
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Failed to save project. Please check the data."
}
```

---

## Step 4: Retrieve Data for Existing Project

You can retrieve the data associated with an existing project to view or work with it in the desktop application.

### Endpoint:
```
GET /projects/{project_id}/data
```

### Explanatory Note:
- Once you save a project, you can access its data by sending a GET request with the **project_id**.
- The data returned will include all the wells and wellbores that are part of the project, allowing you to observe or update the data in your app.

### Response (Success):
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Project data retrieved successfully",
  "project": {
    "project_id": "PRJ-001",
    "project_name": "Project 1",
    "wells": [
      {
        "well_id": "WEL-001",
        "name": "Well 1",
        "location": "Site A",
        "depth": 5000,
        "status": "Active"
      },
      {
        "well_id": "WEL-002",
        "name": "Well 2",
        "location": "Site B",
        "depth": 3000,
        "status": "Inactive"
      }
    ],
    "wellbores": [
      {
        "wellbore_id": "WB-001",
        "well_id": "WEL-001",
        "depth": 1000,
        "status": "Cased",
        "orientation": "Vertical"
      },
      {
        "wellbore_id": "WB-002",
        "well_id": "WEL-002",
        "depth": 1500,
        "status": "Open",
        "orientation": "Horizontal"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Response (Error):
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Project not found."
}
```

## Step 5: Handling Errors

If there is any issue with the API requests, you may encounter the following error codes:

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 400  | **Bad Request**: The request is invalid, often due to missing or incorrect data. |
| 401  | **Unauthorized**: The API key is missing or invalid. Ensure the key is provided and correct. |
| 404  | **Not Found**: The requested resource (e.g., project or well) does not exist. |
| 500  | **Internal Server Error**: An unexpected error occurred on the server side. |

### Explanatory Note:
- Always check the error code and message to troubleshoot and fix the issue. The **400** and **404** errors are typically caused by incorrect or missing data in the request, while **500** errors are typically server-side issues.

---

## Notes:
- **Data Persistence**: Once data is uploaded and saved as a project in the desktop app, it will persist locally. There is no need to re-upload the data unless new information is available.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure that the data provided for wells and wellbores is valid, accurate, and complete to avoid errors during the upload process.

By following these steps and using the provided explanatory notes, you can effectively upload, manage, and save well and wellbore data through the API.
